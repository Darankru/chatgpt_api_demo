# A Terminal-Based AI Chatbot

## Objective

Develop a simple terminal-based chatbot that can understand and respond to natural language queries.
The chatbot should be able to answer questions about a specific domain, such as weather information, using a third-party API.

## Requirements

1. Task Definition:
   - Create a chatbot capable of interpreting and responding to weather-related questions posed in natural language.
   - Utilize a public weather API (e.g., Meteoblue) to retrieve weather data based on the user's query, covering today and the next six days.

2. Natural Language Processing:
   - Implement NLP techniques to parse and understand user queries (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT API â€“ free API calls for new users).
   - Ensure the chatbot can handle variations in phrasing while providing accurate responses (e.g., "What's the weather in New York on September 20, 2024?" or "What's the weather like in Berlin today?").

3. Terminal Interface:
   - Develop the chatbot to operate within a terminal, allowing users to type questions and receive responses directly in the terminal window.

4. Documentation:
   - Provide concise documentation explaining:
     - The architecture of the chatbot.
     - Instructions on how to run the chatbot from the terminal.
     - Any libraries or dependencies required to execute the program.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The chatbot should accurately interpret natural language queries and provide relevant weather information.
- NLP Implementation: Effective use of NLP techniques to understand and respond to user inputs.
- Code Quality: Clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling.
- Documentation: Clear and concise instructions for running the chatbot and understanding its structure.
